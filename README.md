# LLM: AI-Powered Email Automation

## Introduction

Efficient and personalized communication is vital for businesses and individuals alike. This project demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can automate email responses, producing personalized replies that save time and improve workflow efficiency.

Using state-of-the-art conversational AI, this system reads incoming emails and generates human-like, contextual replies, reducing the manual effort needed in customer support and communication tasks.

## Model and Approach

The project uses **Microsoft's DialoGPT-medium**, a transformer-based conversational model designed to generate natural, dialogue-style text. DialoGPT is fine-tuned on conversational data, making it effective for generating replies in a chat or email context.

The workflow involves:

- Loading a set of sample emails,
- Feeding each email's content to the DialoGPT model,
- Generating a personalized response addressed to the sender,
- Printing the replies to simulate an automated email assistant.

## Sample Input Emails

Below are some example emails fed into the model:

| Sender  | Email Content                                                             |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alice   | I'm interested in your product but need more information about pricing and support. Can you help me? |
| Bob     | The charts are not loading on the dashboard. Could you please check this issue? |
| Charlie | Thank you for the great service! I had a wonderful experience with your team. |
| Diana   | Can you provide the delivery schedule for my recent order?                |
| Ethan   | I would like to upgrade my subscription plan. What are the options available? |
| Fiona   | I encountered a bug in the mobile app when trying to upload photos.       |
| George  | Do you offer any discounts for annual subscriptions?                      |
| Hannah  | Please cancel my membership effective immediately.                        |
| Ian     | Is there a way to integrate your service with third-party tools like Zapier? |
| Jane    | I am interested in attending the upcoming webinar. How do I register?     |

## Analysis of Output

The generated replies show that the model is capable of producing short, conversational responses personalized by addressing the sender directly. However, there are some clear limitations:

- **Brevity and Vagueness:** Many replies are very short and somewhat vague (e.g., “I would love to help you out”, “I’m in the same boat”), lacking detailed information or direct answers to the questions posed.
- **Off-topic or Confusing Responses:** The reply to Diana contains a strange back-and-forth dialogue that does not correspond meaningfully to the input email.
- **Inconsistent Professionalism:** Some replies feel informal or offhanded, which might not be suitable for professional communication without further tuning.
- **No Context Retention:** Replies don’t reflect deep understanding of the email content or actionable next steps.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- **Fine-tune the model** on a domain-specific email dataset to improve relevance and tone.
- Use **prompt engineering** techniques to encourage more informative and professional replies.
- Incorporate **summarization** or information extraction to better capture email intent before generating replies.
- Add a **post-processing layer** to validate and enhance generated text for clarity and appropriateness.
