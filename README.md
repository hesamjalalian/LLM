# LLM: AI-Powered Email Automation

## Introduction

Efficient and personalized communication is vital for businesses and individuals alike. This project demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can automate email responses, producing personalized replies that save time and improve workflow efficiency.

Using state-of-the-art conversational AI, this system reads incoming emails and generates human-like, contextual replies, reducing the manual effort needed in customer support and communication tasks.

## Model and Approach

The project uses **Microsoft's DialoGPT-medium**, a transformer-based conversational model designed to generate natural, dialogue-style text. DialoGPT is fine-tuned on conversational data, making it effective for generating replies in a chat or email context.

The workflow involves:

- Loading a set of sample emails,
- Feeding each email's content to the DialoGPT model,
- Generating a personalized response addressed to the sender,
- Printing the replies to simulate an automated email assistant.

## Analysis of Output

The generated replies show that the model is capable of producing short, conversational responses personalized by addressing the sender directly. However, there are some clear limitations:

- **Brevity and Vagueness:** Many replies are very short and somewhat vague (e.g., ‚ÄúI would love to help you out‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the same boat‚Äù), lacking detailed information or direct answers to the questions posed.
- **Off-topic or Confusing Responses:** The reply to Diana contains a strange back-and-forth dialogue that does not correspond meaningfully to the input email.
- **Inconsistent Professionalism:** Some replies feel informal or offhanded, which might not be suitable for professional communication without further tuning.
- **No Context Retention:** Replies don‚Äôt reflect deep understanding of the email content or actionable next steps.

### Suggestions for Improvement

- **Fine-tune the model** on a domain-specific email dataset to improve relevance and tone.
- Use **prompt engineering** techniques to encourage more informative and professional replies.
- Incorporate **summarization** or information extraction to better capture email intent before generating replies.
- Add a **post-processing layer** to validate and enhance generated text for clarity and appropriateness.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical foundation to explore LLM-based email automation. While the current output demonstrates conversational capability, real-world deployment would require additional refinement for accuracy, detail, and professionalism.

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (`transformers`, `torch`, `huggingface_hub`).
3. Run the script to see AI-generated replies to sample emails.
4. Customize and extend the solution for your specific use cases.

## üîß From-Scratch Rule-Based Model

In addition to using pretrained language models, this project includes a rule-based from-scratch version of the email reply generator. This approach is ideal for lightweight, offline scenarios where model loading is impractical. It provides consistent, deterministic outputs and is easy to audit or customize, especially in sensitive business or regulatory environments. By using clear if-else logic tied to keywords, this model ensures rapid, reliable, and resource-efficient replies.

You can find the implementation in the file: `LLM_from_scratch.py`  
Below are some example emails fed into the rule-based model, each followed by its generated reply in red:

## Setup Instructions

To run the email automation script successfully, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure the `sample_emails.json` file is located **in the same directory** as the Python script (`email_automation.py`).

2. The script will automatically load this JSON file at runtime to read the sample emails.
